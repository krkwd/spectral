Divination from the Annulus

The circular diagram you see is The Annulus. Its face is divided into seven spectral colors, each a modality of universal essence: Balance, Transformation, Rhythm, Exchange, Oscillation, Perception, and Magnetism. 

The Spectral Cross is a tool for examining the interplay of energies and principles of The Annulus and the universe. The outcomes you catalyze with each press of the button can be used for guidance or divination.

The Annulus was woven through with the strands of a thousand thoughts. Iâ€™m currently working on a book that outlines the metaphysics behind it, and a long-form video will go up on YouTube shortly. 

As you use the tool, be poised with a question or a situation in your mind. The result will resonate most clearly when addressed with precision.
